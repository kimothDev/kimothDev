## "Experience"

## Currently Learning

* Advanced Stackoverflow Copy-Paste Architecture

* Industrial-strength TODO comment composition
* The ancient art of "Works on My Machine" certification
* Existential Crisis Management for Senior Developers
* Converting coffee directly into React components

## Tech Stack

**Languages I've googled:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, "How to exit vim"

**Frameworks I've had questionable relationships with:** React (current obsession), React Native, Flutter, Next.js

**Libraries/Packages I import then immediately forget how to use:** TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

**Databases that have judged my data modeling:** PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebase, that random CSV Kaggle gave me, Excel (if counts)

**Tools that confuse me:** Docker (black magic), Git (when things go wrong)

**Package managers that have broken my environment:** npm, pip, yarn, conda (somehow always conflicts with itself)

## Philosophy

*"Why write clean code when you can write code that only makes sense at 3 AM?"*

Real developers don't plan. We code first, think later, and refactor never.

*"In a world of senior developers, be a junior with confidence issues."*
